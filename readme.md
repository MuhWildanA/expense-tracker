This app does not use a database. If you want persistent, multi-user data, consider adding a backend (Node.js, Firebase, Supabase, etc.).

Income is any amount > 0.
Expense is any amount < 0.

## 🎥 Inspiration
I built this project by following a tutorial on YouTube that explained how to create an expense tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tutorial helped me learn about DOM manipulation, data persistence with localStorage, and basic state handling in front-end development.
